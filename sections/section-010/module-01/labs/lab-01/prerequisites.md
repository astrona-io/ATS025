# Prerequisites

- The `astrona` command-line tool, installed and working (`astrona check` passes).
- A container engine that kind can use (Podman or Docker) with about 2 GiB of free memory.
- `kubectl` and `jq`.
- You know what a `Role` and a `RoleBinding` are, and how to check an identity with `kubectl auth can-i --as`.

The lab starts a single-node kind cluster (Kubernetes 1.35) with two namespaces, a ServiceAccount and one leftover binding. The commands for the lab are in the README of this folder.
